This git repository stores source code and setup instructions to projects made by me for the group of friends I'm part of called "Grupo dos Canalhas".
## Folder structure

###### Apart from the "discord_bot" project, all others has related apache configurations, see "apache_configs/README"
###### Keep in mind this repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/), you need that to get the assets back, after cloning, run:
